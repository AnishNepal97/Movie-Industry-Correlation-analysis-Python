#Python project

#In this project we are going to explore Movie Industry dataset

#Dataset download from Kaggle 

#Four Decades of movies

#My question before exploring the dataset is:

#1) what makes great movies; by revenue,by rating, and what other factor involves to make movie great?.

#2) what is the co-relation between movie revenue and rating?

#3) how many movies release per years vs success movies?


##feature tools Skills in use:

        #pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib
        
        #first cleaning the data which includes droping duplicates, sorting values by gross, identifying missing values, and looking for outliers
        
        #Finding correlation 
        
        # Correlation Matrix between all numeric columns (pearson method use and found budget and gross has higher correlation)
        
        # visualizing data using seaborn heatmap (sns.heatmap)
        
        #lets looks at the top 15 companies by gross revenue
