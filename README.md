# Movie-Industry-Correlation-analysis-Python
#python project 
#In this project we are going to explore Movie Industry dataset
# dataset download from Kaggle 
# 4 decades of movies
# my question before exploring the dataset is
#1) what makes great movies by revenue,
# by rating, and what other factor involves to make movie great.
#2) what is the co-relation between movie revenue and rating?
#3) how many movies release per years vs success movies?
#and much more;;
